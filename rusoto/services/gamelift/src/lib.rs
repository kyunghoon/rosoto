//! <fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p> Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools to acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, scale game server capacity to meet player demand, and track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance.</p> <p>The Amazon GameLift service API includes important features:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Find game sessions and match players to games – Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure and manage game server resources – Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. We recommend using either the Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">AWS SDK</a>), available in multiple languages, or the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool. Both of these align with the low-level service API. In addition, you can use the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift for many administrative actions.</p> <p>You can use some API actions with Amazon GameLift Local, a testing tool that lets you test your game integration locally before deploying on Amazon GameLift. You can call these APIs from the AWS CLI or programmatically; API calls to Amazon GameLift Local servers perform exactly as they do when calling Amazon GameLift web servers. For more information on using Amazon GameLift Local, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/integration-testing-local.html">Testing an Integration</a>.</p> <p> <b>MORE RESOURCES</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/">Amazon GameLift Developer Guide</a> – Learn more about Amazon GameLift features and how to use them. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/tutorials">Lumberyard and Amazon GameLift Tutorials</a> – Get started fast with walkthroughs and sample projects.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gamedev/">GameDev Blog</a> – Stay up to date with new features and techniques.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://gamedev.amazon.com/forums/spaces/123/gamelift-discussion.html">GameDev Forums</a> – Connect with the GameDev community.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/doc-history.html">Amazon GameLift Document History</a> – See changes to the Amazon GameLift service, SDKs, and documentation, as well as links to release notes. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>API SUMMARY</b> </p> <p>This list offers a functional overview of the Amazon GameLift service API.</p> <p> <b>Finding Games and Joining Players</b> </p> <p>You can enable players to connect to game servers on Amazon GameLift from a game client or through a game service (such as a matchmaking service).
